# create a markdown and recommendation on how to showcase this content on the pricing page and not be duplicative of the landing page content or other pages -- the attached

Here’s how to present your pricing page content so that it’s not duplicative of your landing page or other areas, and fully showcases the features and user experience highlighted in the attached screenshots.

***

## Recommendations for the Pricing Page

- **Don’t repeat general product claims or generic marketing lines.** Those belong on your home or landing page. Focus instead on what users actually experience after sign-up—specific value, features, and proprietary capabilities.
- **Use real UI screenshots tastefully** (show 1–2 per key feature at most, toggled via tabs or modals, not all stacked together). This visually demonstrates sophistication and clarity.
- **Showcase workflow and outcomes:** Display step-by-step process examples for CME tracking, compliance dashboards, license management, and document upload using cropped images and concise captions.
- **Highlight advantages using context:** Describe the impact of features with “How this works for you,” connecting pricing tiers to tangible results.
- **Connect advanced features directly to pricing tiers:** For Team and Enterprise, spotlight custom reporting, analytics, and on-demand support as “unlocked” value, not just a checklist.

## How to Avoid Duplication

- Point users to explore main features (“See screenshots of real workflows below”) rather than reiterating generic benefits.
- On the landing page, keep messaging high-level (“Automate compliance, reduce risk, and boost productivity”).
- Let the pricing page provide *proof*: UI, actions, and outcomes delivered with each plan, so the user knows what they get for their money.
- Reserve more technical details, integration info, and deep BI features for dedicated product or “features” subpages.

Present pricing as clear and direct, then use images and captions to immediately answer “What do I get if I sign up today?”—bridging the gap between feature promises and lived experience. This drives conversions and confidence without overlap with your main site content.
