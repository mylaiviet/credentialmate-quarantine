TRK-11005525,Feature,CME Classification Prompt Optimization Phase 2,Add few-shot examples to distinguish training certificates from CME and reorder classification steps for CME priority,Tested,High,2025-11-11 00:55:25,2025-11-11 00:55:33,20251111-005516,,Claude Code,AI Test Script,Pass,2025-11-11 00:55:33,,,"Test: Classification accuracy 95%+, field extraction 90-100%, CME step reordering verified working"
TRK-11005551,Testing,API Centralization Impact Testing - LLM Access Verification,Verify AWS Bedrock access and document parsing pipeline after API centralization initiative,Tested,High,2025-11-11 00:55:51,2025-11-11 00:56:00,20251111-005516,,Claude Code,AI Test Script,Pass,2025-11-11 00:56:00,,,"Test: LLM access verified working. Classification accuracy 95%, field extraction 90-100%, cost <$0.015/doc, processing time normal. API centralization has ZERO impact on Bedrock integration."
TRK-11005611,Bug,Critical: CME Step Ordering in Classification Prompt,Fixed bug where CME documents were misclassified as state_license. Root cause: classification steps checked state_license BEFORE CME. Fixed by reordering steps to check CME in Step 2.,Created,High,2025-11-11 00:56:11,2025-11-11 00:56:11,20251111-005516,,Claude Code,,,,,,
